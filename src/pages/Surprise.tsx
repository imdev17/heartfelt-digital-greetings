Every day with you feels like a beautiful dream that I never want to wake up from. You are the sunshine that brightens my darkest days, the melody that makes my heart sing, and the home I never knew I was searching for.

From the moment you walked into my life, everything changed. Your smile became my favorite sight, your laugh became my favorite sound, and your happiness became my greatest mission.

Today, as we celebrate another year of your wonderful existence, I want you to know that you are loved beyond measure. You are cherished, adored, and absolutely perfect just as you are.

Thank you for being you. Thank you for choosing us. Thank you for making every ordinary moment feel extraordinary.

Here's to another year of adventures, laughter, love, and countless beautiful memories together.`;
